*************************************************************************************************************

Models.py - Python class for a model of chemical reactions (coupled or a series of chemical reactions)
          - Input:
               a list of chemical reaction functions, and an array of rate constants, booleans to specify static rate constants or oscilatting rate constants
	  - Contains Gillespie algorithm
          - Contains example models 
            TwoColorStatic_Q, SingleColorStaticOscillating_Q, SingleColorStaticNoiseRatioTest_QR, SingleColorStaticOscillating_QR, SingleColorStatic_SQR

NoiseAlgorithm.py  - Contains functions for computing single color and dual color reporter noise


Parameters.py - input parameters, this  class is inherited by model class


Plots.py - Contains functions for plotting results of gillespie simulations

SingleColorReactions.py - Function definitions for single color chemical reactions

TwoColorReactions.py - Function definitions for dual color single reactions

SpecialCases.py - This python script is used as an example to test stochastic fluctuations in several models of chemical reactions
	Included Options:
    		Single Color Static Oscillating Simulation Q (0->Q, Q->0 simple birth death, with oscilating birth rate using single color algorithm)
    		Two Color Static Simulation Q (0->Q, Q->0 simple birth death using two color algorithm)
    		Comparison of Two and Single Color Simulation Q (compare two different algorithms)
    		Noise Ratio Test in QR Reaction via Single Color(Q->Q+R, R->0, 0->Q, Q->0, comparison of noise in R vs Q static birth rates)
    		Static Oscillating Noise Propogation in QR Reaction via Single Color (Q->Q+R, R->0, 0->Q, Q->0, birth rate for Q oscilated, what is the effect in noise of R?)


Example Plots are in Plots folder
